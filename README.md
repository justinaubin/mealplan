This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

MealPlan is an unfinished project which aims to create an easier, more user friendly for students to see the current attendance, predicted attendance, and menu for thier dining halls. The project uses React.js and several .js components to create the frontend UI, and Flask and app.py to create the backend.

To run the project:

1. first go to the flask-server folder and run the command "flask run". This will get the backend server up and running, sending the mealplan data, dining hall attendance, etc to a localhost.

2. run "npm start" in the main project folder to start the React, frontend server

3. Once both server load up you can click through the different pages currently available (see the Components folder in src). 

Stay tuned for further updates and work on this app
